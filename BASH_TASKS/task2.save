# Task 2
# Write a script that would take 2 arguments - a directory (DIR) and a number (N)
echo "Please provide the directory name"
read directory
echo "Please provide the number on which to check on subdirectory"
read nr
# If the first argument is not a directory, print "not a directory"
if [ -d "$directory" ];

else
echo "dir does not exist"
fi
# Otherwise print N entries (files/subdirectories) from DIR
# If DIR contains less than N entries, print all the entries and "No more entries" string at the end

# Task 3
# Do the same as in Task 2, but print N lexicographically last entries
# Consider using `sort` or `ls -r`
